This project is a Twitter sentiment analysis tool developed using deep learning techniques to analyze tweets' sentiments. The aim of this project is to provide insights into the sentiment expressed by Twitter users towards specific topics or entities. It utilizes a combination of Tokenization, GloVe Word Embeddings, Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and an Attention layer to analyze and classify tweets' sentiment (Positive and Negative).
